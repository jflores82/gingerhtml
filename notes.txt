GingerHtml Notes
---------

General Information : 
Ginger HTML is a pretty simple HTML / Text editor, made entirely by me, in Visual Basic 6. It supports opening HTML/SHTML/M3U and TXT files, (along with *.* for any other extension.). And it features a F12 hit for saving and testing in Internet Explorer. It was made to stop my madness-like renaming when making/editing a website : rename to .txt, open in notepad, save, rename to .html, open in ie/firefox, test, rename to .txt, etc. etc. It is pretty simple and not feature full and it will stay that way. 

Download : 
There's only one version available for download, along with full Visual Basicsource code for it.
